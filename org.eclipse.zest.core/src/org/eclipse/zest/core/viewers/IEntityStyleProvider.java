/**
 * An extension to Label providers for graphs. Gets specific details about the
 * style of an entity before it is created. This style provider offers:
 *
 * -Background and forground colours -Hilighted and unhighlighted colours
 * (colours defined by selections). -Border color. -Highlighted and
 * unhighlighted colours for borders. -Border width -Font for text inside the
 * entity.
 *
 * Any method may return null if the Zest defaults are preferred.
 *
 * NOTE: It is up to the implementors of this interface to dispose of any Colors
 * or Fonts that are created by this class. The dispose() method will be called
 * at the end of the entity's life-cycle so that this class may dispose of its
 * resources.
